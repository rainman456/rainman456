## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Andre**, a mostly self-taught programmer and systems enthusiast with a deep curiosity for how things work under the hood â€” from low-level bits and bytes to distributed systems.

 I spend most of my time exploring systems programming, reverse engineering, and building tools that help me (and others) understand complex systems better.

 Currently, Iâ€™m working on different projects and launching my personal blog mostly about those projects â€” expect technical deep-dives, dev logs, and research write-ups coming soon!

 Feel free to reach out or connect with me on [X](https://x.com/DersonEfox) â€” Iâ€™m always open to chat, collaborate, or just nerd out about tech.
