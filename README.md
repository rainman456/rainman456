## Hi there 👋

I'm **Andre**, a mostly self-taught programmer and systems enthusiast with a deep curiosity for how things work under the hood — from low-level bits and bytes to distributed systems.

🔬 I spend most of my time exploring systems programming, reverse engineering, and building tools that help me (and others) understand complex systems better.

🛠️ Currently, I’m working on launching my personal blog — expect technical deep-dives, dev logs, and research write-ups coming soon!

📬 Feel free to reach out or connect with me on [X](https://x.com/DersonEfox) — I’m always open to chat, collaborate, or just nerd out about tech.
